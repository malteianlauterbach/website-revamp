																						of data we call internet while moving across germany
																									with 1/3 of the speed of sound with 0 emissons, 
																										crazy how transportation improves over . 
																										I wonder when, in the history of the internet,
																										for the first time it was cheaper to send a 1 Giagabyte file 
																										via the internet instead of physically shipping it by mail.
																										It's astonishing for me how I can click a single button on a web application 
																										and then establish an communication with technically everyone with an interent connection in this world.
																										In a recent conversation with Zach Latta, the founder of Hack Club,
																										I said something I'd like to repeat here.
																										I believe that, if we give students from all over the world a base to meet each other, 
																										have them oversee their differences, the pressure and hate that is implanted by their peers, 
																										the general consesus of their sub civilization, 
																										i think we can influence how we, as humans, as one generation, 
																										as one civilization see each other,
																										how teens see teens from other countrys.
																									After World War Two, France and Germany agreed to have yearly student exchanges with each other,
																									to overcome the hate france and germany had against each
																									other after two world wars that tore their family apart.
																									I believe that the internet is similar to that, if used correctly.
																									Any leader with an high impact on a community that is truly international ,
																									who uses the tools given to him (his influence) will be able to establish understanding and change.
																									I believe that we, you and I, my dear reader, as the ones with the ability to engage users will and should be the ones to do it.
																									Better today than tomorrow.
																								
																										If you wonder where the title of this post comes from,
